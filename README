LavaTime is a Rails 2.1 application that tracks how much time hourly workers spend on projects.  It was originally written by and for a web development company called LavaFire, Inc (http://www.lavafireinc.com) to track projects, tasks, and the amount of time each worker spends on each task.  This information can be used for computing payroll, invoices to clients, and employee performance reports based on hour estimats and due dates of tasks and projects.  

LavaTime is intended to be general time tracking and project management software.  We welcome your comments, feedback and commits.
